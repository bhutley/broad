# BROAD - Brett's Repo of Algorithms and Datastructures

This is a repo of Algorithms and Datastructures I am creating as a reference to the main algorithms used in coding competitions. The code will primarily be C++.

I am creating this for my own reference, but my hope is that it will be useful to others.
